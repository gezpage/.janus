This plugin is meant to simplify a task I've found too common in my workflow: switching between a single-line statement and a multi-line one.

I usually work with ruby and a lot of expressions can be written very concisely on a single line. A good example is the "if" statement:

    puts "foo" if bar?

This is a great feature of the language, but when you need to add more statements to the body of the "if", you need to rewrite it:

    if bar?
      puts "foo"
      puts "baz"
    end

The idea of this plugin is to introduce a single key binding for transforming a line like this:

    <div id="foo">bar</div>

Into this:

    <div id="foo">
      bar
    </div>

And another binding for the opposite transformation. This currently works for:
  * Various constructs in Ruby and Eruby
  * Various constructs in Coffeescript
  * Various constructs in Perl
  * PHP arrays
  * Python dicts and simple statements
  * Javascript object literals
  * Tags in HTML/XML
  * CSS, SCSS, LESS style declarations.
  * YAML arrays
  * Lua functions
  * Vimscript line continuations
